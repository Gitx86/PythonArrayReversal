# PythonArrayTransposer
PythonArrayTransposer tool, without numpy/pandas


## How it works
- Takes in an array
- Understand the shape of the array (Rol, Col)
- using a for loop, loop with output col then row

## TODO
1) create a class that takes in array

## Notes
Im using this to learn about classes and how to integrate this into other code
