# PythonArrayTransposer
Python List Array Transposer tool, without numpy/pandas

## How it works
- Takes in an array
- Understand the shape of the array (Rol, Col)
- Using a "for" loop, iterate the array col first, then row
- Append those into a "Array"/list for output


## Notes
Im using this to learn about classes and how to integrate this into other code
